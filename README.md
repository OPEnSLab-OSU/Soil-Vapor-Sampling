# Soil-Vapor-Sampling

The Vapor Soil Sampler is a coupler meant to hold microporous tubing by screwing two pieces together. The tubing will allow gas to flow through, and then it will be analyzed on the surface.

Here you will be able to find the STL file to be able to print the coupler.

This project was made using Fusion 360, so there is no code you can download because it is all visual design. Here you will find the link to be able to download the piece and 3D print it.
